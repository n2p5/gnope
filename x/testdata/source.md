# Hi, I'm Nathan.

This page may look simple now, but its built using a little tool I built called [chonk](/p/n2p5/chonk/). It allows me to completely replace the markdown, which is kind of nice if I change my mind about things. [I can even preview the next version of this page before publishing it as well](/r/n2p5/home:preview).
